# Nand2Tetris
This repository contains all the projects that were part of the course CS2300 and CS2310 in Indian Institute Of Technology Madras.

The projects completed are as described in https://www.nand2tetris.org/.
All the projects together are aimed at building a computer called HACK from the fundamentals (using basic NAND gates) in a 
bottom up approach. The various projects involve building bits, registers, multiplexors, demultiplexors, multi way AND, OR, NOT gates etc.

Later we build the RAM upto size 16K. We also build the ALU chip which serves the foundation for CPU chip . All of this is integrated 
finally to build the computer chip.

The hardware is built virtually with the help of Hardware Description Language (HDL).

The code for these projects are present in the files and project folders 3, 4, 5.

The second half of the project involves building system software to run programs on HACK as the native hardware.

We first built a simple 2 pass assembler for HACK architecture.

This is followed by building a Virtual Machine Interpreter for a low level Virtual Machine to be run on HACK.

Finally we build a compiler for a programming language called JACK (an abridged from of JAVA) which abstracts the Virtual Machine for
code generation.

The code for the following is present in project 9. Projects 6 - 8 contain test cases for the above 3 projects completed.
